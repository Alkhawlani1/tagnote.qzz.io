### ‚ùî FAQ

#### How many free domain names can be registered? üöÄ  
Currently, the limit is 3. Due to the high volume of domain abuse, we are no longer reviewing applications to expand the domain registration limit. However, we may reopen the option to request limit expansions in the future. In the meantime, you can set up subdomains via your DNS panel (e.g., example.foo.us.kg).

#### Which DNS platforms can I use this domain with?  
You can use it with virtually any DNS management system! Just input the provided platform‚Äôs NS records or your own into the DigitalPlat FreeDomain panel (e.g., Try Cloudflare if you're not sure). Feeling adventurous? You can even set up your own DNS system‚ÄîPowerDNS and BIND are excellent choices to get started!

#### Do I need add star for this project?
You don't have to do this, but if you add a star, we would be deeply grateful! It helps more people discover the project. Since this is a non-profit initiative, let's work together to make the internet a more open and free place! Thank you!

#### Domain Name Risk Alert?  
Unfortunately, we are currently working on addressing this issue. As of December 12, 2024, our domain has been listed on the Spamhaus domain blocklist due to extensive abuse. We are actively communicating with Spamhaus to resolve the matter and remove the abusive domains as quickly as possible. You can follow our progress here: [GitHub Progress Update](https://github.com/DigitalPlatDev/US.KG-Issues/issues/14).
