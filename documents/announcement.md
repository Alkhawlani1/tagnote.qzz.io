Due to the misuse of the **US.KG** domain by certain criminal organizations, it has been reported to the **.KG** registry. As a result, the **.KG** domain registry has **suspended DNS resolution** for all **\*.US.KG** domains, making them temporarily inaccessible.  

We have already responded to the **.KG** registry and are now waiting for them to restore DNS resolution. This process may take some time, so we kindly ask for your patience. In the meantime, we recommend checking our **official repository** or **joining our discussion group** for the latest updates:

This suspension was **a decision made by the .KG registry and not by us**. Typically, **US.KG** domains should be restored soon.  

We appreciate your understanding and support. Moving forward, we will **enhance our review mechanisms and implement KYC measures** to prevent further misuse, ensuring a safer and freer internet for everyone.  

Thank you for your patience! üôè

The US.KG domain has been fully restored, and all domains are functioning normally. If you are unable to resolve the domain properly, please clear your DNS cache or wait up to 24 hours for full DNS propagation.

We are actively communicating with Kyrgyzstan (.KG domain registry) to ensure that similar incidents are minimized as much as possible. We emphasize proactive collaboration and encourage any issues to be discussed with us in advance to guarantee stable service.

We regret to inform you that the .KG registry has set the status of US.KG to "Inactive" and enforced a suspended resolving status. As a result, all registered *.US.KG domains are temporarily unable to resolve and are currently inaccessible.

Please rest assured that we are actively communicating and collaborating with the .KG registry to resolve this issue as swiftly as possible. We are implementing enhanced measures to prevent similar incidents in the future and are working tirelessly to restore full service.

In the meantime, please do not worry. If this situation impacts your business, we strongly recommend taking the following actions:

Switch to Backup Domains: If you have a backup domain available, please transition to it as soon as possible.

Set DNS Manually: You can configure your computer's DNS settings to 142.171.123.133, which will allow you to continue using your *.US.KG domains without interruption.
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding. Further updates will be provided as soon as we have new information.

Thank you for your continued support.
